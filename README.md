- 👋 Hi, I’m @andreasgottardi
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps technologies, Java, Dotnet, Python, administrating systems and any sort of clean data structures in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Dotnet and I am working with Java most of the time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automatable projects in defining processes for the whole application life cycle: From planing, developing over releasing to archiving.
- 📫 How to reach me is via GitHub, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-gottardi-68b72016a) or [Skype](mailto:andreas.gottardi@outlook.at).
- 🔮 My future topics are Docker, Kuberentes and combining this with automated pipelines for building, publishing and deploying applications.
